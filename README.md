# menu-selector
program to select weekly meals. You will be able to add meals into different category's, and the program will plan a weeks worth of food. There are some cool features that i may or may not implement like add the plan to google calendar.

THESE ARE MY INITIAL IDEAS!!!!!!

To randomly select meals for the week and choose from different category's. Use database. Make this with tkinter for now. Maybe change it so it can go on the app store. 

Little details:
The database fields/ tables: The name of the meal, category's, main ingredients, comment section 

Maybe features:

Login system

Google calendar intergration

Send email to customer once a week with the meal plan.

Images for food/ingredients


Features i want in the app:

Entry interface(be able to choose which category your food/meal can go into.)














	View the database
	
	
	
Random select(It will randomly select meals for that week. There needs)



	






Check that each meal is unique AFTER EACH DAY OF FOOD IS SELECTED.

Entry interface:


Add a date to the database each time something is entered.

Delete record from specified table

Edit record from specified table.
